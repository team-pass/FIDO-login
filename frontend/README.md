# :art: FIDO Login Frontend
This folder contains the frontend for our web app, which is built using HTML/CSS/JS and styled using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com). Currently, we have a login page, a registration page, and a user profile page.

## :file_folder: Project Structure
The project is broken up as follows:

- `*.html`: HTML files for the login, registration, and user profile pages
- `assets/`: Stores all media for the project (e.g., images, fonts, CSS)

## :rocket: Quick Start
Simply open any of the `*.html` files in a web browser to see what they look like :smile:
